# Machine learning for Blockchain Security
 The study collected tweets containing keywords related to blockchain security and network congestion over a period of time, and analyzed them using natural language processing techniques. The sentiment analysis was performed to understand how users perceive the security and scalability of blockchain platforms. The results of the study suggest that users have mixed perceptions of blockchain security and network congestion. While some users express confidence in the security and scalability of blockchain technology, others express concerns about the potential for security breaches and network congestion.
The first stage involved getting an academic license for twitter scrapping and then performed some preprocessing steps to clean the text data before performing sentiment classification. This could have included removing unwanted characters and symbols, such as punctuation marks, emoticons, and special characters, which are not relevant to the sentiment of the text. Additionally, I have removed links or URLs from the text, as they do not contribute to the sentiment of the text and could potentially introduce noise into the analysis.
After cleaning the text data, I used a polarity sentiment tool to perform the actual sentiment classification. A polarity sentiment tool typically uses a pre-trained model to classify text as either positive, negative, or neutral in sentiment. The tool analyzes the text by looking for specific keywords or phrases that are commonly associated with positive or negative sentiment, and then assigns a sentiment score to the text based on the presence or absence of these keywords.

The polarity sentiment tool can be useful for NLP tasks that require quick and easy sentiment analysis, but it is important to keep in mind that the tool's accuracy may be limited by its pre-trained model and the specific domain or context of the text being analyzed. Additionally, using a polarity sentiment tool typically requires some preprocessing and cleaning of the text data to ensure accurate results.

In my NLP project, I used LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) algorithm for sentiment analysis of tweets. The model achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 96%, indicating that it was able to accurately identify the sentiment of the tweets. LightGBM is a powerful gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms to build predictive models. It is designed to handle large-scale data with high efficiency and can be used for various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and ranking. The high accuracy of your model suggests that it was able to learn and generalize from the features extracted from the text data, and was able to distinguish between positive and negative sentiment expressions in the tweets. This is a promising result that demonstrates the effectiveness of using LightGBM for sentiment analysis in NLP applications.
